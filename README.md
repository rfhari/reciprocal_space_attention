# Reciprocal Space Attention (RSA) for Learning Long-Range Interactions

# Abstract
Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the modeling of materials and molecules by directly fitting to ab initio data. However, while these models excel at capturing local and semi-local interactions, they often prove insufficient when an explicit and efficient treatment of long-range interactions are required. To address this limitation, we introduce Reciprocal-Space Attention (RSA), designed to capture long-range interactions in the Fourier domain. RSA can be seamlessly integrated with any existing local or semi-local MLIP framework. Our key contribution is mapping the linear-scaling attention mechanism into Fourier
space. This technique allows us to effectively capture long-range interactions, such as electrostatics and dispersion, without requiring predefined charges or other explicit empirical assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of benchmarks, including the dimer binding curve, dispersion interactions in layered phosphorene exfoliation, and molecular dynamics simulation of water. Our results show that RSA successfully captures long-range interactions in various such chemical environments
